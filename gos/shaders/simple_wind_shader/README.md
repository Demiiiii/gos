# Simple Wind Shader

A simple 2D shader for the godot engine that give sprites like grass or plants a wiggle/wind effect.
This shader is a ported version of the [3D version](https://github.com/Maujoe/godot-simple-wind-shader)

## How to use

There is a demo scene in the demo folder where you can test all features and play with the settings.

If you don't need the demo just ignore the demo folder and connect your mesh with the wind_shader_2d.shader file that can be found in the shaders folder.
